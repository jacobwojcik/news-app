# News App
### [Live version](https://jacobwojcik.github.io/news-app/)

YourNews is a simple website, which provides news shortcuts. Made with [![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-61dafb?style=flat-square&logo=react&logoColor=white)]().
My main goal was to learn styling websites by using styled-components. Also I fetch news thanks to [https://saurav.tech](https://saurav.tech/NewsAPI/) API.
